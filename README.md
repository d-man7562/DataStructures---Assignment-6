# DataStructures---Assignment-6
Creates a treeMap within a treeMap to handle car accident reports. The outer treeMap sorts reports by states, with each state key having values that are treeMaps of dates, with each date key having a value of an arrayList that adds every report with a matching state and date to it.

This program will require an input of state and date and will return the number of reports that took place in the state, on and after the specified date. 

This program is designed to be run via command-line arguments.

in PowerShell:

 - Compile the programs

 - input "java program6 [state] [date]"
[state] should be in USA's state ticker format, i.e., ME, CA, etc.,
[date] should be in yyyy-mm-dd format and be between 2021 and 2022

Have fun!
